<h1> Too Good At Goodbyes</h1>
<h3>Song line: Baby, we don’t stand a chance, it’s sad but it’s true, I’m way too good at goodbyes.</h3>
<h3>Song: Too Good At Goodbyes, released in 2017</h3>
<h3>Artist: Sam Smith (British)</h3> 
<h3>Lesson Link: losing in love</h3> 
<h3>Notes: According to Sam Smith, this song is about a relationship he was in. The singer explains that the song is about his progress with an emotional relationship, and the last time it happened he was not ready and was sad.</h3>
<h3>Full letter: You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I know you're thinkin' I'm heartless
I know you're thinkin' I'm cold
I'm just protectin' my innocence
I'm just protectin' my soul
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you'll see me cry (no way that you'll see me cry)
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes), no
No, no, no, no, no (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No, no, no, no
No, no, no (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
(No way that you'll see me cry)
Ah-ah, ah-ah (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
'Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes.</h3>

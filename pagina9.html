<h3>Full letter: Hell down, heaven now
Living in the same town
Trying find something new
Broken picture frame
I've been frozen in
Trying to find a better view
This ain't me, this ain't cool
This ain't what I signed up to
This ain't right, it's no good
No good, oh
Everything is Changing
And I've been here for too long
Going through the same things
I've been hurt and done wrong
Got to move on, say
Ah, I can't do this anymore
If everything is Changing
Then I know, yeah gotta let
Go, oh-oh, go, oh-oh, oh
Go, oh-oh, go, oh-oh, oh-oh
Go, oh-oh, go, oh-oh, oh
Go, oh-oh, go, oh
Gotta let go, oh-oh, go, oh-oh, oh
Go, oh-oh, go, oh-oh, oh-oh
Go, oh-oh, go, oh-oh, oh
Gotta let go, yeah!
I don't understand playing by the same hand
How you'll find something new
I can't work it out, what it's all about
I won't live my life through you
This ain't real, this ain't true
This ain't what I signed up to
This ain't right, it's no good
No good, oh
Everything is Changing
And I've been here for too long
Going through the same things
I've been hurt and done wrong, got to move on, say
I, I can't do this anymore
If everything is Changing
Then I know, yeah, gotta let
Go, oh-oh, go, oh-oh, oh
Go, oh-oh, go, oh-oh, oh-oh
Go, oh-oh, go, oh-oh, oh
Go, oh-oh, go, oh
Gotta let go, oh-oh, go, oh-oh, oh
Go, oh-oh, go, oh-oh, oh-oh
Go, oh-oh, go, oh-oh, oh
Gotta let go, yeah!
I've been here for too long
I've been here for too long
I've been here for too long
I've been here for too long
I've been here for too long
I've been here for too long
I've been here for too long
Everything is Changing
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Hmm, mm, mm
Hmm, mm, mm

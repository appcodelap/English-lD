<h1> Video Killed The Radio Star</h1>
<h3>Song line: They took the credit for your second symphorny. Rewritten by machine on new technology.</h3>
<h3>Song: Video Killed The Radio Star, released in 1979</h3>
<h3>Artist: Buggles (British)</h3> 
<h3>Lesson Link: technology</h3> 
<h3>Notes: Trevor Horn, who started Buggles, wrote this song with Bruce Wooley, after reading a science fiction novel about a singer in a future
world without sound. The song was the first video to air on MTV in 1981. and that also served as an early indicator of the network's influence in the world of music.</h3>
<h3>Full letter: I heard you on the wireless back in Fifty Two
Lying awake intent at tuning in on you
If I was young it didn't stop you coming through

Oh-a oh

They took the credit for your second symphony
Rewritten by machine and new technology
And now I understand the problems you can see

Oh-a oh

I met your children
Oh-a oh

What did you tell them?
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star

Pictures came and broke your heart
Oh-a-a-a oh

And now we meet in an abandoned studio
We hear the playback and it seems so long ago
And you remember the jingles used to go

Oh-a oh

You were the first one
Oh-a oh

You were the last one

Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
In my mind and in my car, we can't rewind we've gone to far
Oh-a-aho oh
Oh-a-aho oh

Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star

In my mind and in my car, we can't rewind we've gone to far
Pictures came and broke your heart, put the blame on VCR

You are a radio star
You are a radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star

Video killed the radio star (you are a radio star)</h3>

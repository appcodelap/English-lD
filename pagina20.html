<h1> Another Brick in the Wall</h1>
<h3>Song line: Hey, Teacher, leave them kids alone! All in all you’re just another brick in the wall.</h3>
<h3>Song: Another Brick in the Wall, released in 1979</h3>
<h3>Artist: Pink Floyd (British)</h3> 
<h3>Lesson Link: education</h3> 
<h3>Notes: The song written by Pink Floyd is a reflection of Roger Water’s views on formal education. Waters hated his grammar school teachers who demanded total control, were dedicated to keeping students under control and treated students more like parts in a machine than as people with ideas. Waters thought that school presented a series of emotional barriers the singer had to build around himself to survive at school.</h3>
<h3>Full letter: We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher, leave them kids alone
Hey! Teacher! Leave them kids alone!
All in all, it's just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers, leave them kids alone
Hey! Teacher! Leave us kids alone!
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall
Wrong, do it again!
Wrong, do it again!
If you don't eat your meat
You can't have any pudding!
How can you have any pudding
If you don't eat your meat?
You! Yes!
You, behind the bike sheds!
Stand still, laddie!</h3>

<h3>Full letter: Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know, it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So, you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
And you won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And is the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So, you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
And you won't ever be alone

And if you hurt me
That's okay, baby
Only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

So you could fit me
Inside the necklace you got
When you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat, where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on 6th Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home</h3>

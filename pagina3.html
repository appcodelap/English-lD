<h1>Friends</h1>
<h3>Song line: Have I made it obvious? Haven't I made it clear? Want me to spell it out for you?F-R-I-E-N-D-S.</h3>
<h3>Song: Frirends, released in 2018.</h3>
<h3>Artist: Marshmello (American), feat. Anne-Marie (British)</h3> 
<h3>Lesson Link: Friends</h3>
<h3> Notes: The idea for the lyrics of this song was inspired by a male friend of Anne-Marie's who, according to her, actually wanted to be more than just friends with her. The singer doesn't say who it is but she hopes that the song won't ruin her friendship with the guy.</h3> 
<h3>full letter: Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

You say you love me, I say you crazy
We're nothing more than friends
You're not my lover, more like a brother
I known you since we were like ten, yeah

Don't mess it up, talking that shit
Only gonna push me away, that's it
When you say you love me, that make me crazy
Here we go again

Don't go look at me with that look in your eye
You really ain't going away without a fight
You can't be reasoned with, I'm done being polite
I've told you one, two, three, four, five, six thousand times

Haven't I made it obvious?
Haven't I made it clear?
Want me to spell it out for you?
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
Haven't I made it obvious?

Want me to spell it out for you?
F-R-I-E-N-D-S
F-R-I-E-N-D-S

Have you got no shame? You looking insane
Turning up at my door
It's two in the morning, the rain is pouring
Haven't we been here before?

Don't mess it up, talking that shit
Only gonna push me away, that's it
Have you got no shame? You looking insane
Here we go again

So don't go look at me with that look in your eye
You really ain't going away without a fight
You can't be reasoned with, I'm done being polite
I've told you one, two, three, four, five, six thousand times

Haven't I made it obvious? (Haven't I made it?)
Haven't I made it clear? (Haven't I made it clear?)
Want me to spell it out for you?

Get that shit inside your head
No, no, yeah, uh, ah

We're just friends

So don't go look at me with that look in your eye
You really ain't going nowhere without a fight

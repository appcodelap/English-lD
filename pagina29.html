<h1> Lips Are Movin</h1>
<h3>Song line: I might be young, but l ain't stupid, Talking around in circles
with your tongue.</h3>
<h3>Song: Lips Are Movin, released in 2015</h3>
<h3>Artist: Meghan Trainor (American)</h3> 
<h3>Lesson Link: might</h3> 
<h3>Notes: Lips Are Moving is a song which appears to be about the singer breaking up with her cheating boyfriend. However, the song is really about Meghan's frustration with her record label, not a cheating boyfriend. Lips Are Movin was the singer's second single and, just like her first one, All About That Bass, this song has a retro sound and uses the same basic structure.</h3>
<h3>Full letter: If your lips are movin', if your lips are movin'
If your lips are movin', then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby
If your lips are movin', if your lips are movin' (oh)
If your lips are movin', I said you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby
Boy, look at me in my face
Tell me that you're not just about this bass
You really think I could be replaced?
Nah, I come from outer space
And I'm a classy girl, I'ma hold it up
You're full of something, but it ain't love
And what we got, straight overdue
Go find somebody new
You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny
Ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye
Bye-bye-bye
I know you're lyin' (lyin') 'cause your lips are movin' (movin')
Tell me, do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young (young), but I ain't stupid (stupid)
Talking 'round in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass (bass), you gave me sweet talk (sweet talk)
Saying how I'm your number one
But I know you're lyin' (lyin') 'cause your lips are movin' (movin')
Baby, don't you know I'm done?
If your lips are movin', if your lips are movin'
If your lips are movin', then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby
If your lips are movin', if your lips are movin' (oh)
If your lips are movin', I said you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby
Hey, baby don't you bring them tears
'Cause it's too late, too late, baby, oh-oh
You only love me when you're here
You're so two-faced, two-faced babe, oh
You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny
Ny-ny-ny, deny-ny (yes, you can baby)
But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye
Bye-bye-bye (hey)
I know you're lyin' (lyin') 'cause your lips are movin' (movin')
Tell me, do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young (young), but I ain't stupid (stupid)
Talking 'round in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass (bass), you gave me sweet talk (sweet talk)
Saying how I'm your number one
But I know you're lyin' (lyin') 'cause your lips are movin' (movin')
Baby, don't you know I'm done?
Come on, say
If your lips are movin' (hey, hey), if your lips are movin' (hey, hey)
If your lips are movin', then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby
If your lips are movin', if your lips are movin'
If your lips are movin', then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby (here we go)
I know you're lyin' (lyin') 'cause your lips are movin' (movin')
Tell me, do you think I'm dumb? (Oh-oh)
I might be young (young), but I ain't stupid (stupid)
Talking 'round in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass (bass), you gave me sweet talk (sweet talk)
Saying now I'm your number one
But I know you're lyin' (know you're lyin') 'cause your lips are movin' (your lips are movin')
Baby, don't you know I'm done?</h3>

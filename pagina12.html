<h1> True</h1>
<h3>Song line: Why do I find it hard to write the next line? Oh, I want the truth to be said, I know this much is true.</h3>
<h3>Song: True, released in 1983.</h3>
<h3>Artist: Spandau Ballet (British)</h3> 
<h3>Lesson Link: facts and opinions.</h3> 
<h3>Notes: According to Spandau Ballet's guitarist Gary Kemp, he wrote the lyrics of this song inspired by a crush he had on singer and star Clare Grogan. The musician said that, despite the fact that his feelings were not reciprocated and their relationship was only platonic, he felt this was enough to write a song about.</h3>
<h3>Full letter: Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
So true, funny how it seems
Always in time, but never in line for dreams
Head over heels when toe to toe
This is the sound of my soul
This is the sound
I bought a ticket to the world
But now I've come back again
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
Oh I want the truth to be said
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true
With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue
Dissolve the nerves that have just begun
Listening to Marvin (all night long)
This is the sound of my soul
This is the sound
Always slipping from my hands
Sand's a time of its own
Take your seaside arms and write the next line
Oh I want the truth to be known
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true
I bought a ticket to the world
But now I've come back again
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
Oh I want the truth to be said
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true
This much is true
This much is true
This much is true
I know, I know, I know this much is true
This much is true
This much is true (huh huh)
This much is true
This much is true
I know this much is true
This much is true (huh huh)
This much is true (I know this much is true)
This much is true (huh huh)
This much is true (I know this much is true)
I know, I know, I know this much is true.</h3>

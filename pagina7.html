<h1>Heal the World.</h1>
<h3>Song line: Heal the world, Make it a better place, For you and for me and the entire human race.</h3>
<h3>Song: Heal the World, released in 1991.</h3>
<h3>Artist: Michael Jackson (American). </h3> 
<h3>Lesson Link: Making the world a better place, sustainability.</h3>
<h3> Notes: This song was written and produced by Michael Jackson. it was criticized at the time, because it was considered  too similar to the U.S.A for Africa single We are the world, which Michael Jackson co-wrote. In 2001, Michael said in an interview that  this song, which was about man's inhumanity to his fellow man, was the song he was most proud of having written.</h3> 
<h3>full letter: There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be
Much brighter than tomorrow

And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make it a better place
For you and for me

If you want to know why
There's love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving

If we try, we shall see
In this bliss
We cannot feel fear or dread
We stop existing and start living

Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better world

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this Earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly, be God's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel
You are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears

See the nations turn their swords
Into plowshares
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
You and for me
(Make a better place)
You and for me
(Make a better place)
You and for me
(Make a better place)
You and for me
(Heal the world we live in)
You and for me
(Save it for our children)
You and for me
(Heal the world we live in)
You and for me
(Save it for our children)
You and for me
(Heal the world we live in)
You and for me
(Save it for our children)
You and for me
(Heal the world we live in)
You and for me
(Save it for our children)

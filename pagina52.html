<h1> Human</h1>
<h3>Song line: I'm only human. I make mistakes. I'm only human. That's all it takes. Don't put your blame on me.</h3>
<h3>Song: Human, released in 2016</h3>
<h3>Artist: Rag'n'Bone Man (British)</h3> 
<h3>Lesson Link: mistakes</h3> 
<h3>Notes: This song is an expression of human beings' vulnerability and it talks about the singer's inability to satisfy everyone's needs. Human was Raq'n'Bone Man's first hit single. It topped the charts in several countries, including Germany, where it stayed at the top of the charts for Over three months.</h3>
<h3>Full letter: (I'm only human)
(I'm only, I'm only)
(I'm only human, human)

Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind
Thinking I can see through this and see what's behind
Got no way to prove it, so maybe I'm lying

But I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me
Don't put your blame on me

Take a look in the mirror and what do you see?
Do you see it clearer or are you deceived
In what you believe?

'Cause I'm only human after all
You're only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me

(Oh-oh) some people got the real problems
(Oh-oh) some people out of luck
(Oh-oh) some people think I can solve them
(Oh-oh) Lord heavens above

I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

Don't ask my opinion, don't ask me to lie
Then beg for forgiveness for making you cry
Making you cry

'Cause I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

(Oh-oh) oh, some people got the real problems
(Oh-oh) some people out of luck
(Oh-oh) some people think I can solve them
(Oh-oh) Lord heavens above

I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

I'm only human, I make mistakes
I'm only human, that's all it takes
To put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

(Ooh) 'cause I'm no prophet or Messiah
(Ooh) you should go looking somewhere higher

I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

I'm only human, I do what I can
I'm just a man, I do what I can
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me</h3>

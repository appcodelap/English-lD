<h1> Wolves</h1>
<h3>Song line: I've been running through the jungle, I've been running with the wolves, To get to you, to get to you, I've been down the darkest alleys, Saw the dark side of the moon to get to you.</h3>
<h3>Song: Wolves, released in 2017. </h3>
<h3>Artist: Selena Gomez (American) feat. Marshmello (American).</h3> 
<h3>Lesson Link: present perfect and present perfect continuous.</h3> 
<h3>Notes: This song is a collaboration between Selena Gomez and music producer and Dj Marshmello, Selena says that the DJ created a really cool tune from a rough demo Andrew Watt (a songwriter she's worked with for years) sent him. She says that besides being a very beautiful and personal song, the lyrics also have a whole story behind them.</h3>
<h3>Full letter: In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love and one to lose
Sweet divide, a heavy truth
Water or wine, don't make me choose
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Ah ah aah, to get to you
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Ah ah aah, to get to you
Your fingertips trace my skin
To places I have never been
Blindly I am following
Break down these walls and come on in
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Ah ah aah, to get to you
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Ah ah aah, get to you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you.</h3>

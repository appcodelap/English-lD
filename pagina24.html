<h1> Careless Whisper</h1>
<h3>Song line: I should've known better than to cheat a friend, And waste a chance that l've been given. So l'm never qonna dance again, The way I danced with you.</h3>

<h3>Artist: George Michael (British)</h3> 
<h3>Lesson Link: regrets / should have
past perfect</h3> 
<h3>Notes: This song was co-written by George Michael and his bandmate
Andrew Ridgeley when they were 17 years old. The lyrics were inspired

<h3>Full letter: 
Oh, oh, oh
Oh
I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh, oh

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste this chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

Never without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say

We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me?
Please, stay!

And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Oh, oh

(Now that you're gone) now that you're gone
(Now that you're gone) what I did's so wrong, so wrong
That you had to leave me alone

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh</h3>

<h1> Bitter Sweet Symphony</h1>
<h3>Song line: It's a bittersweet symphony, this life. Try to make ends meet.
You're a slave to the money, then you die.</h3>
<h3>Song: Bitter Sweet Symphony, released in 1997</h3>
<h3>Artist: The Verve (British)</h3> 
<h3>Lesson Link: money</h3> 
<h3>Notes: The Verve's lead singer, Richard Ashcroft, says that the song
reflects his experience learning that money and happiness do not always
go together. To explain the line "Try to make ends meet, you're a slave
to money, then you die", Ashcroft says that his father had worked nine to
five to make ends meet and died very young, when Richard was just 11
years old and his sisters even younger.</h3>
<h3>Full letter: Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, that's life
Tryna make ends meet, you're a slave to money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah
No change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold
I am here in my mold
But I'm a million different people
From one day to the next
I can't change my mold
No, no, no, no, no
(Have you ever been down?)
Well, I've never prayed but tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singin' to me now
No change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold
I am here in my mold
And I'm a million different people
From one day to the next
I can't change my mold
No, no, no, no, no
(Have you ever been down?)
I can't change, oh, no
I can't change, oh
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, that's life
Tryna make ends meet, tryna find somebody then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah
You know I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold
I am here in my mold
And I'm a million different people
From one day to the next
I can't change my mold
No, no, no, no, no
I can't change my mold
No, no, no, no, no,
I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no
It's just sex and violence, melody and silence
It's just sex and violence, melody and silence
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
Been down
Ever been down
Ever been down
Ever been down
Ever been down
Have you ever been down?
Have you ever been down?
Have you ever been down?

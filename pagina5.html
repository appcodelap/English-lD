<h1>What Do You Mean?.</h1>
<h3>Song line: What Do You Mean? When you nod your head yes, But you wanna say no. What Do You Mean?.</h3>
<h3>Song: What Do You Mean?, released in 2015.</h3>
<h3>Artist: Justin Bieber (canadian). </h3> 
<h3>Lesson Link: opinions.</h3>
<h3> Notes: Bieber said this song is about how "flip-floppy" girls are. According to the singer, girls sometimes say one thing when they actually mean something else, and this song is about this. It would appear that Bieber really does want an answer to the question that's the title of the song, as he repeats What Do You Mean? 20 times throughout the song!.</h3> 
<h3>full letter: What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?

Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're so indecisive, what I'm saying
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?

First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, making love all night
First you're up, then you're down and then between

Oh, I really wanna know

What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-yeah
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?

Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're overprotective when I'm leaving
Tryna compromise but I can't win
You wanna make a point, but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end

First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, making love all night
First you're up, then you're down and then between
Oh, I really wanna know

What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-yeah
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?

(I wanna know)
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
(Oh baby)
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

Oh, oh (this is ours baby, yeah)
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
(You're so confusing baby) Hey-yeah
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?

(Be more straight forward)
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean.</h3>

<h1> How To Save A Life</h1>
<h3>Song line: Where did I go wrong? lost a friend somewhere alonlg the bitterness. And I would have stayed up wíth you all night, Had i known how to save a life.</h3>
<h3>Song: How To Save A Life, released in 2005</h3>
<h3>Artist: The Fray (American)</h3> 
<h3>Lesson Link: third conditional</h3> 
<h3>Notes: The Fray's lead singer, Isaac Slade, said in an interview that he wrote this song based on an experience he had been through when he
worked at a camp for troubled youths. He explained that he was paired up with one boy, with drug and addiction problems, who was įust 17 years old, but he didn't know how to help him.</h3>
<h3>Full letter: Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say sit down, it's just a talk
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left, and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came
Where did I go wrong?
I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And I pray to God he hears you
And where did I go wrong?
I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came
Where did I go wrong?
I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong?
I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
How to save a life
How to save a life
Where did I go wrong?
I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong?
I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
How to save a life
How to save a life</h3>

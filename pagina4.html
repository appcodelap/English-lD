<h3>full letter: Every night, in my dreams,
I see you, I feel you.
That is how I know you go on.
Far, across the distance
And spaces between us,
You have come to show you go on.

Near, far, wherever you are,
I believe that the heart does go on.
Once more, you opened the door.
And you're here in my heart.
And my heart will go on and on.

Love can touch us one time,
And last for a lifetime.
And never let go till we're gone.
Love was when I loved you,
One true time to hold on to.
In my life, we'll always go on.

Near, far, wherever you are,
I believe that the heart does go on.
Once more, you opened the door.
And you're here in my heart.
And my heart will go on and on.

You're here, there's nothing I fear.
And I know that my heart will go on.
We'll stay, forever this way.
You are safe in my heart.
And my heart will go on and on.</h3>

<h1> America</h1>
<h3>Song line: There's nothing on the TV, nothing on the radio. That means
that much to me.</h3>
<h3>Song: America, released in 2006</h3>
<h3>Artist: Razorlight (British)</h3> 
<h3>Lesson Link:TV and radio programs </h3> 
<h3>Notes: According to Razorlight's drummer, Andy Burrows, the idea for the drumbeat of this song came up when they were in a hotel in Ohio and they heard a Billy Joel record. Johnny Borrel, the bandleader, asked for a similar sound, so that's what inspired the drumbeat for this song.</h3>
<h3>Full letter: What a drag it is
The shape i'm in
Well I go out somewhere
Then I come home again

I light a cigarette
'Cause I can't get no sleep
Theres nothing on the TV nothing on the radio
That means that much to me

All my life
Watching America
All my life
There's panic in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh
There's trouble in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh

Yesterday was easy
Happiness came and went
I got the movie script
But I don't know what it meant

I light a cigarette
'Cause I can't get no sleep
Theres nothing on the TV nothing on the radio
That means that much to me
Theres nothing on the TV nothing on the radio
That I can believe in

All my life
Watching America
All my life
There's panic in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh
There's trouble in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh
There's panic in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh

Yesterday was easy
Yes I got the news
When you get it straight, but stand up you just can't lose
Give you my confidence, all my faith in life

Dont stand me up
Don't let me down
I need you tonight
To hold me, say you'll be here
To hold me, say you'll be here
To hold me, say you'll be here
To hold..

All my life
Watching America
All my life
There's panic in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh
She's just in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh

Tell me how does it feel
Tell me how does it feel
Tell me how does it feel
Tell me how does it feel</h3>

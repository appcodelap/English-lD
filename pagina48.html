<h1> Pretty Fly (For A White Guy)</h1>
<h3>Song line: Now he's getting a tattoo, yeah, he's getting ink done, He asked for a "13" but they drew a"31".</h3>
<h3>Song: Pretty Fly (For A White Guy), released in 1998</h3>
<h3>Artist: The Offspring (American)</h3> 
<h3>Lesson Link: causative form</h3> 
<h3>Notes: The Offspring guitarist, Noodle, said in an interview that the Song is about a kid that wants to blend in with the "cool" gangsters, but just can't manage to do so and, instead, makes a fool of himself. The Song was number one in several countries' charts.</h3>
<h3>Full letter: (Gunter glieben glauten globen)
(Give it to me, baby)
Uh-huh, uh-huh
(Give it to me, baby)
Uh-huh, uh-huh
(Give it to me, baby)
Uh-huh, uh-huh
And all the girlies say I'm pretty fly for a white guy

Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis

You know, it's kinda hard just to get along today
Our subject isn't cool, but he fakes it anyway
He may not have a clue and he may not have style
But everything he lacks, well, he makes up in denial

So don't debate a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field and keep it real
For you, no way
For you, no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world needs wannabes, ah
So, hey, hey, do that brand new thing

(Give it to me, baby)
Uh-huh, uh-huh
(Give it to me, baby)
Uh-huh, uh-huh
(Give it to me, baby)
Uh-huh, uh-huh
And all the girlies say I'm pretty fly for a white guy

He needs some cool tunes, not just any will suffice
But they didn't have Ice Cube, so he bought Vanilla Ice
Now cruising in his Pinto, he sees homies as he pass
But if he looks twice, they're gonna kick his lily ass

So don't debate a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field and keep it real
For you, no way
For you, no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world wants wannabes, ah
So, hey, hey, do that brand new thing

Now he's getting a tattoo, yeah, he's getting ink done
He asked for a thirteen, but they drew a thirty-one
Friends say he's trying too hard and he's not quite hip
But in his own mind, he's the, he's the dopest trip

(Give it to me, baby)
Uh-huh, uh-huh
(Give it to me, baby)
Uh-huh, uh-huh
(Give it to me, baby)
Uh-huh, uh-huh

Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis

So don't debate a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field and keep it real
For you, no way
For you, no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world needs wannabes, ah
The world loves wannabes, ah
Let's get some more wannabes, ah
So, hey, hey, do that brand new thing</h3>

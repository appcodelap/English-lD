<h1> Break the Rules</h1>
<h3>Song line: I don’t want to go to school, I just wanna to break the rules.</h3>
<h3>Song: Break the Rules, released in 2014.</h3>
<h3>Artist: Charli XCX (British).</h3> 
<h3>Lesson Link: Breaking the rules.</h3> 
<h3>Notes: Charli XCX said that this song came when she was phasing out of caring about anything any more. In the lyrics, the singer apparently sings a about not worrying about anything. Later, the singer admitted that she is actually anxious and so this song was a bit of a release.</h3>
<h3>Full letter: Electric lights
Blow my mind
But I feel alright
And never stop, it's how we ride
Comin' up until we die
You catch my eye
If you wanna fly
I'm so alive
Never stop, it's how we ride
Comin' up until we die
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Go into the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Go into the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
I'm such a star
Queen boulevard
Blaze through the dark
And never stop, it's how we ride
Comin' up until we die
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Go into the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Get my guitar
Sunglasses on
So light it up
And never stop, it's how we ride
Comin' up until we die
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Go into the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na.</h3>

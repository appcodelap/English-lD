<h1> Paper Planes</h1>
<h3>Song line: AIl I wanna do is (bang, bang, bang!) And a (kkkaaa ching!) And take your money.</h3>
<h3>Song: Paper Planes, released in 2007</h3>
<h3>Artist: M.I.A (British)</h3> 
<h3>Lesson Link: shopping/ spending money</h3> 
<h3>Notes: This song was inspired by M.I.A.'s efforts to enter the U.S. on a visa. She is British but of Sri Lankan descent, and the whole bureaucratic
process took months to complete, which M.I
A. attributed to the color of her skin and her real name, Mathangi Arulpragasam. The song uses a
sample of a 1982 Clash song, Straight To Hell.</h3>
<h3>Full letter: I fly like paper, get high like planes
If you catch me at the border, I got visas in my name
If you come around here, I make 'em all day
I get one done in a second if you wait
I fly like paper, get high like planes
If you catch me at the border, I got visas in my name
If you come around here, I make 'em all day
I get one done in a second if you wait
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every stop I get to, I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a winner, we're making our fame
Bona fide hustler making my name

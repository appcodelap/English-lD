<h1> Cheap Thrills</h1>
<h3>Song line: Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight.</h3>
<h3>Song: Cheap Thrills, released in 2016</h3>
<h3>Artist: Sia (Australian).</h3> 
<h3>Lesson Link: shopping / spending money</h3> 
<h3>Notes: This song was Sia's first hit as a performer to reach the Hot 100 chart-she had previously reached number 1 as a writer for Rihanna's Diamonds. There's also a remix of the track featuring reggae singer Sean Paul.</h3>
<h3>Full letter: Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Friday night, and it won't be long
Gotta do my hair, put my make-up on
It's Friday night, and it won't be long
'Til I hit the dance floor, hit the dance floor
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
But I got you, baby
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
But I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Saturday, and it won't be long
Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on
It's Saturday, and it won't be long
'Til I hit the dance floor, hit the dance floor
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
But I got you, baby
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing
I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing
(Oh, oh, oh)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
But I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing
La-la-la-la-la
(I love cheap thrills)
La-la-la-la-la
(I love cheap thrills)
La-la-la-la-la
(I love cheap thrills)
La-la-la-la-la
(I love cheap thrills)</h3>
